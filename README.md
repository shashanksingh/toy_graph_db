# Toy GraphDB

Just a toy graph db so that we can play around with graph algorithms 

# Aim

Use Cases I want to test out with this
1. Use a DAG of currency conversion to find how we can make money by doing rapid currency conversion AKA
Given a grid of currency conversion , between few currencies find Eulerian circuit 
that has to get X% over money over what I started.  
2. Find degree of friendship
3. For Grid : load a image as grid and find components in it, aka edge detection
